1   Series
Definition 1.1. A series is the sum of the items in a sequence.
    Finite sums are always well defined, while infinite sums must meet certain
criteria to be well defined. A finite sum up to term aN would be denoted
                                             N
                                             &#x2211;
                     n=0 an = SN
While an infinite sum, that is the limit of a finite sum (assuming the limit exists)
is denoted as
                            lim 
N&#x2192;&#x221E;SN =  lim 
N&#x2192;&#x221E; N
         &#x2211;
    n=0 an =  &#x221E;
 &#x2211;
 n=0 an = S
If the above limit exists, the series is convergent, while if it doesn&#8217;t, the series
is divergent.
Definition 1.2. A geometric series is one where terms are related by a
common ratio r.   The general geometric series up to order N could be
expressed as
                        SN = a + ar + ar2 + &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5; + arN = S
N
The formula for a finite geometric series is
                                      SN = a(1 - rN) 
   1 - r                                (1)
and the formula for an infinite geometric series (assuming the series exists,
i.e. assuming |r| &#x003C; 1) is simply (by taking the limit N &#x2192;&#x221E;),
                                          S =    a __
1 - r                                 (2)
                                                             1                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          where in both cases, a and r represent the first term and common ratio,
respectively.
          
Definition 1.3. The remainder RN is the difference between the infinite
series S and the &#8220;partial sum&#8221; SN, that is,
                                RN =    &#x221E;
  &#x2211;
 k=N+1 ak = S - SN
     Series are a way of breaking something difficult into a sum of easy to handle
terms.
1.1   Tests for Convergence
Definition 1.4 (Comparing Magnitudes). 
                           f &#x226A; g  &#x21D0;&#x21D2; lim 
n&#x2192;&#x221E; f(n) 
g(n) = 0
    Do note some general relative magnitudes of growth:
                              log n &#x226A; n &#x226A; n2 &#x226A; ... &#x226A; 2n &#x226A; n!                          (3)
1.1.1   Preliminary Test
If limn&#x2192;&#x221E; an &#x2044;= 0, then &#x2211;&#x221E;
  n  an diverges.
1.1.2   Integral Test
If an is non-negative and non-increasing, then
                     &#x221E;
           &#x2211;
          n=1 an  converging  &#x21D0;&#x21D2; &#x222B; &#x221E;
  b   a(x)dx converging
where a(x) is the continuation of an for the real variable x; e.g. if an = 1&#x2215;n,
then a(x) = 1&#x2215;x, where x &#x2208; &#x211D;.
1.1.3   Comparison Principle
Suppose an and bn are sequences with 0 &#x2264; an &#x2264; bn for all n.
                           &#x2211;
               bn  converges &#x21D2;&#x2211;
   an  converges.
                             &#x2211;
                an  diverges &#x21D2;&#x2211;
   bn  diverges.
                                                             2                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          1.1.4  Special Comparison Principle
          If an, bn are non-negative sequences and limn&#x2192;&#x221E; an 
bn  &#x003C; &#x221E; (that is to say, the
          limit is finite), then
                           &#x2211;
                              bn  converges &#x21D2;&#x2211;
   an  converges.
          1.1.5  Ratio Test
          Defining
                         &#x03C1;n = | |
| |an+1 
  an  | |
    | |,  &#x03C1; =  lim 
n&#x2192;&#x221E;&#x03C1;n =  lim 
n&#x2192;&#x221E;| | 
| |an+1 
  an  | |
       | |
          then
                              &#x03C1; &#x003C; 1 &#x21D2; the series converges.
                              &#x03C1; &#x003E; 1 &#x21D2; the series diverges.
                              &#x03C1; = 1 &#x21D2; the test is inconclusive.
          1.1.6  Alternating Series Test
          If an is an alternating series (i.e., sign(an+1) = -sign(an)), |an+1|&#x2264;|an|, and
          limn&#x2192;&#x221E; = 0, then the series converges.
             Note: if &#x2211;
  |an| converges, the series is absolutely convergent.
          1.2   Power Series
Definition 1.5. A power series is a function expressed as an infinite sum
of monomials. That is, a function f(x) can be expanded in a power series
if it can be expressed as
                        f(x) =  &#x221E;
 &#x2211; 
n=0 anxn
for some {an}.
Theorem 1.1. A power series expansion of f(x) converges on only 3 types
of intervals.
    1. It converges everywhere (that is, &#x2200;x)
    2. It converges for x = 0 only
    3. It converges when |x| &#x003C; R and diverges when |x| &#x003E; R, where R is
     the radius of convergence.  (The points x = ±R must be checked
     explicitly and are not, in general, symmetric.)
1.2.1  Taylor Series
                                                      3                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          Definition 1.6. The power series expansion of an analytic function about
a number a is known as a Taylor series.  When a = 0, this is known as a
Maclaurin series. If f(x) is analytic,
f(x - a) = f(a) + f&#x2032;(a)(x - a) + f&#x2032;&#x2032;(a) 
  2!   (x - a)2 + &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5; + f(n) 
  n!  (x - a)n + &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5;
Note: the radius of convergence for Taylor series depends upon a.
   Here are some common Maclaurin series, with their interval of convergence
in parentheses:
     sin(x)    =    &#x221E;
                &#x2211;

1.2.2  Asymptotic Notation
How do we write lower order terms we are not concerned with so that we can
keep track of them? With &#8220;Little-oh&#8221; and &#8220;Big-Oh&#8221; notation!
Definition 1.7 (Little-oh notation). Given continuous functions f(x) and
g(x), we say that f(x) = o(g(x)) as x &#x2192; a if
                          lim
                         x&#x2192;a f(x)____
g(x) = 0
e.g. x5 = o(x) as x &#x2192; 0, x4 = o(x5) as x &#x2192;&#x221E;, etc.
Definition 1.8 (Big-Oh notation). Given continuous functions f(x) and
g(x), we say that f(x) = (g(x)) as x &#x2192; a if
                        lim
                        x&#x2192;a ||
                            ||f(x)____
g(x)||
                                || &#x003C; &#x221E;
                                4                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          e.g. x2 = O(x2) as x &#x2192; 0, 2sinx = O(1) as x &#x2192;&#x221E;, etc.
   The rules for manipulating the notation is as follows:
    1. If c &#x2208; &#x211D; and f(x) = o(g(x)), then cf(x) = o(g(x)).
  2. If f1(x) = o(g1(x)) and f2(x) = o(g2(x)), then f1(x)f2(x) = o(g1(x)g2(x)).
  3. If f(x) = o(g(x)), then x &#x22C5; f(x) = o(x &#x22C5; g(x)).
  4. If lim 
x&#x2192;0 g(x) = 0, then      1 _____
1 + g(x) = 1 - g(x) + o(g(x)).
  5. o(f(x) + g(x)) = o(f(x)) + o(g(x))
  6. o(o(f(x))) = o(f(x))
   All of the above apply to &#8220;Big-Oh&#8221; notation as well.
1.3   Error of Series Approximations
In general, the error for a finite power series can be expressed as
      RN(x) = f(x) -(
 f(x) + (x - a)f&#x2032;(a) + &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5; + (x - a)N f(N)(a) 
   N!    )
                                                               (4)
            = (x - a)N+1f(N+1)(c) 
        (N + 1)!                                     (5)
   for some c &#x2208; [a,x].  This is known as Taylor&#8217;s Theorem.  However, it is not
of much practical use, as we do not have a formula for c.
   In  the  case  where  the  power  series  coefficients  are  decreasing  and  non-
negative, on the interval x &#x2208; (-1,1) we can use the formula
                         RN(x) = aN+1xN 
 1 -|x|                        (6)
   In the case where the (not necessarily power) series is alternating, and ab-
solutely decreasing (that is, |an+1| &#x003C; |an| for all n) and limn&#x2192;&#x221E; an = 0, then
                           |RN|&#x2264;|aN+1|.                        (7)
2   Linear Algebra
2.1   Notation
   &#x2219; A vector in a vector space is denoted as x.
   &#x2219; The coordinate vector of x with respect to a basis <img src="cmsy10-42.png" alt="B" /> is denoted as [x]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />. If
     there is no subscript, e.g.  [x], the basis is understood to be the standard
     basis.
   &#x2219; The standard basis elements are denoted e1,e2,...en.
                                                             5                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          2.2   Coordinates and Change of Bases
          The coordinate mapping of a transformed vector T(x) is given simply as
                    [T(x)] = [
 [T(e1)]   [T(e2)]   &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5;  [T(en)]]
                     [x] = [T][x].        (8)
             In a basis <img src="cmsy10-42.png" alt="B" /> with basis {bi}, the transformation can be written
                [T(x)]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" /> = [
 [T(b1)]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />  [T(b2)]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />  &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5;  [T(bn)]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />]
                        [x]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" /> = [T]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />[x]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />.    (9)
             To switch between these two transformation matrices, we have
                          [T] = B[T]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />B-1  &#x21D0;&#x21D2; [T]
<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" /> = B-1[T]B             (10)
             where
                               B = [
 [b1]   [b2]   &#x22C5;&#x22C5;&#x22C5;  [bn]]
               .                 (11)
             From the above, we can see
                             [x]<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" /> = B[x]  &#x21D0;&#x21D2; [x] = B-1[x]
<img src="cmsy7-42.png" alt="B" />.                (12)
          2.3   Diagonalization
Definition 2.1. To diagonalize a matrix A is to express it as A = CDC-1,
where C is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonal matrix.
TODO: How to diagonalize a matrix.
Definition 2.2. An orthogonal matrix is a real matrix which has the fol-
lowing (mutually equivalent) properties:
    1. All its columns (if treated as column vectors) are orthogonala
    2. Its transpose equals its inverse,  e.g. if A is an orthogonal matrix,
     AT = A-1.
______________
   aIn the inner product sense. See section INSERT SECTION HERE for details.
Theorem 2.1.  If A is symmetric (i.e. A =  AT),  then it also has the
following properties:
    1. It is diagonalizable
    2. Its basis is orthogonal
    3. All its eigenvalues are real
                                                             6                                                   

                                                                                                                 
          Definition 2.3. The adjoint of a matrix A is A&#8224; = (AT)*.  This is pro-
nounced &#8220;A dagger.&#8221;
